# microRNA_noise

Here deposites the code for simulating gene expression noise modulated by microRNA as well as calculating gene expression noise from flow cytometry data.

## Simulate gene expression noise modulated by microRNA

Run `simulation/solve_noise.m` to simulate noise, and run `simulation/plot_noise.m` to plot noise.
